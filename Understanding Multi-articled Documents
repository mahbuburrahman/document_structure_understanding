Few sentences:
A document has an obvious hierarchical geometric structure in its layout, represented by a tree, while the logical structure of a 
document is also represented by a tree. According to them document understanding is the transformation of a geometric structure tree into 
a logical structure tree.

Logical structure is representing the configuration of articles and their components, indicates the order in which the document is to
be read.

Their experiments are on printed documents.
